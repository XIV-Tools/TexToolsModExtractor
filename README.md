# TexTools Mod Extractor

A super simple and lightweight tool to extract the individual assets from a TexTools modpack (TTMP/TTMP2). 

Currently only supports images- `.tex` files will be exported as `.png` for use in image editing programs, etc.

Model conversion to `.fbx` is pending.

## Prerequisites

## Installation

Just extract the `.zip` it to a folder. Doesn't matter where!

## How to Use

1. Select your mod pack (TTMP or TTMP2)
2. Select the folder you want to extract it to
3. Press Extract
4. Give it a sec
